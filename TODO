* a basic Python module for ease of use
* a basic stats tool to chain onto sample
* a (either git-like or uses-git) tool which at least dedupes or otherwise
  stores away stdout/stderr output from large runs; bonus points for also
  storing the run data from sample alongside this data somehow
* for more, just grep TODO *.{h,c}
